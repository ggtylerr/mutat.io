    <p>mutat.io is the ultimate conversion app that has been built from the ground up, and has been in development since March 1st 2020.</p>
    <p>The web app wouldn't have been possible without the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>repl.it, for hosting the website and providing the main IDE</li>
      <li>node.js, express.js, and UptimeRobot, for allowing a way to host it 24/7 (and allowing for such things as an API)</li>
      <li>JQuery, Font Awesome 5, math.js, and MathJax, for being amazing libraries</li>
      <li>StackOverflow, which provided 99% of the answers to random coding issues I encountered</li>
      <li>The Wikipedia page for unit conversion, which provided both the techniques and conversion factors for units</li>
      <li>Any of my friends, colleagues, family, etc, who I pestered to test out versions of the app</li>
      <li>You, for checking out mutat.io!</li>
    </ul>
